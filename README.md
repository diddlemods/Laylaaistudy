# Laylaaistudy


To define the API connections between Llama.cpp and Layla AI, we need to consider several key aspects to ensure seamless integration, security, and performance. Here's a structured approach to establishing these connections:

### 1. **API Endpoints**
   - **Initialization**: Create an endpoint to start a local AI session using Llama.cpp. This could be a POST request to `/api/llama/init` with parameters like model path, configuration settings, etc.
   - **Termination**: Implement an endpoint to stop the local AI session, such as a POST request to `/api/llama/terminate`.
   - **Query Handling**: Develop endpoints to send prompts to the local AI and receive responses. For example, a POST request to `/api/llama/query` with the prompt as input and the AI response as output.
   - **Session Management**: Include endpoints to manage multiple sessions, such as listing active sessions or retrieving session status.

### 2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - **Token-Based Authentication**: Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate users accessing the API. Users must provide a valid token in the request headers.
   - **API Keys**: Implement API keys for developers integrating Layla AI with Llama.cpp, ensuring only authorized applications can interact with the API.
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define roles to control access levels, ensuring that users can only perform actions they are authorized to do.

### 3. **Data Transfer**
   - **Data Formats**: Use standard formats like JSON for data exchange. Ensure that prompts and responses are clearly structured and easy to parse.
   - **State Management**: Implement mechanisms to maintain session state, allowing users to resume conversations or retrieve previous interactions.
   - **Error Handling**: Include detailed error messages in responses to help users and developers troubleshoot issues effectively.

### 4. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all API interactions, including errors, for monitoring and debugging purposes. Use centralized logging tools for efficient management.
   - **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure the API can handle errors gracefully, providing fallback mechanisms to maintain service availability.

### 5. **Performance and Scalability**
   - **Load Balancing**: Distribute API requests across multiple instances of Llama.cpp to handle high loads efficiently.
   - **Resource Management**: Monitor and manage system resources to prevent overloading, ensuring optimal performance for each session.
   - **Caching**: Implement caching strategies to reduce latency and improve response times for frequently accessed data.

### 6. **Integration with Existing Features**
   - **Character Creation**: Allow users to specify whether they want their AI character to run on a local Llama.cpp instance or a cloud-based service.
   - **Scenario Settings**: Enable configuration options within Layla AI to tailor the AI's behavior based on the local model's capabilities.
   - **User Interface**: Provide a unified interface where users can manage their local AI sessions alongside other features of Layla AI.

### 7. **Documentation and User Guides**
   - **Developer Documentation**: Provide detailed API documentation, including endpoint descriptions, request/response formats, and examples.
   - **User Guides**: Create guides for users on how to set up and use Llama.cpp with Layla AI, including installation instructions and troubleshooting tips.
   - **Best Practices**: Share best practices for optimizing performance, ensuring security, and maintaining a good user experience.

### 8. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Unit Testing**: Conduct thorough unit tests for each API endpoint to ensure they function as expected.
   - **Integration Testing**: Test the integration between Layla AI and Llama.cpp to ensure seamless interaction across different components.
   - **Performance Testing**: Validate the API's performance under various loads to ensure scalability and reliability.

### 9. **Challenges and Considerations**
   - **Compatibility**: Regularly update the API to maintain compatibility with new versions of Llama.cpp and Layla AI.
   - **Resource Management**: Optimize resource usage to prevent local machines from becoming overwhelmed, ensuring a smooth user experience.
   - **User Education**: Educate users on the benefits and proper use of local AI sessions to maximize adoption and satisfaction.

By addressing these aspects, we can establish robust and efficient API connections between Llama.cpp and Layla AI, enhancing the platform's capabilities and user experience.

# Character Card V2: Specification

This document describes new JSON fields added to the embedded JSON of V1
character cards. V1 refers to the format currently in use across the character
card ecosystem as of May 4th 2023.

[Character Card V1 Specification for new implementers](./spec_v1.md)

[Read the definitions of MUST, SHOULD, and MAY](./keyword_definitions.md)

**This spec has been validated on May 17th and is ready for adoption.**

## Table of contents

- [New fields](#new-fields)
  * [`spec`](#spec)
  * [`spec_version`](#spec_version)
  * [`creator_notes`](#creator_notes)
  * [`system_prompt`](#system_prompt)
  * [`post_history_instructions`](#post_history_instructions)
  * [`alternate_greetings`](#alternate_greetings)
  * [`character_book`](#character_book)
  * [`tags`](#tags)
  * [`creator`](#creator)
  * [`character_version`](#character_version)
  * [`extensions`](#extensions)

## New fields

The V1 (current) spec can be described with this TypeScript definition:

```ts
type TavernCardV1 = {
  name: string
  description: string
  personality: string
  scenario: string
  first_mes: string
  mes_example: string
}
```

The V2 spec can be described with:

```ts
type TavernCardV2 = {
  spec: 'chara_card_v2'
  spec_version: '2.0' // May 8th addition
  data: {
    name: string
    description: string
    personality: string
    scenario: string
    first_mes: string
    mes_example: string

    // New fields start here
    creator_notes: string
    system_prompt: string
    post_history_instructions: string
    alternate_greetings: Array<string>
    character_book?: CharacterBook

    // May 8th additions
    tags: Array<string>
    creator: string
    character_version: string
    extensions: Record<string, any>
  }
}

/**
 * ? as in `name?: string` means the `name` property may be absent from the JSON
 * (aka this property is optional)
 * OPTIONAL PROPERTIES ARE ALLOWED TO BE UNSUPPORTED BY EDITORS AND DISREGARDED BY
 * FRONTENDS, however they must never be destroyed if already in the data.
 *
 * the `extensions` properties may contain arbitrary key-value pairs, but you are encouraged
 * to namespace the keys to prevent conflicts, and you must never destroy
 * unknown key-value pairs from the data. `extensions` is mandatory and must
 * default to `{}`. `extensions` exists for the character book itself, and for
 * each entry.
 **/
type CharacterBook = {
  name?: string
  description?: string
  scan_depth?: number // agnai: "Memory: Chat History Depth"
  token_budget?: number // agnai: "Memory: Context Limit"
  recursive_scanning?: boolean // no agnai equivalent. whether entry content can trigger other entries
  extensions: Record<string, any>
  entries: Array<{
    keys: Array<string>
    content: string
    extensions: Record<string, any>
    enabled: boolean
    insertion_order: number // if two entries inserted, lower "insertion order" = inserted higher
    case_sensitive?: boolean

    // FIELDS WITH NO CURRENT EQUIVALENT IN SILLY
    name?: string // not used in prompt engineering
    priority?: number // if token budget reached, lower priority value = discarded first

    // FIELDS WITH NO CURRENT EQUIVALENT IN AGNAI
    id?: number // not used in prompt engineering
    comment?: string // not used in prompt engineering
    selective?: boolean // if `true`, require a key from both `keys` and `secondary_keys` to trigger the entry
    secondary_keys?: Array<string> // see field `selective`. ignored if selective == false
    constant?: boolean // if true, always inserted in the prompt (within budget limit)
    position?: 'before_char' | 'after_char' // whether the entry is placed before or after the character defs
  }>
}
```

A frontend supporting both V1 and V2 would hence use a type looking like:

```ts
type TavernCard = TavernCardV1 | TavernCardV2
```

If you're unsure what this means in plain JavaScript terms, check out [the "Proposed fields" section introduction of the explainer](./README.md#proposed_fields)

**All V1 fields follow [the V1 spec](./spec_v1.md), other than being nested
inside the `data` property.**

### `spec`

The value for this field **MUST** be `"chara_card_v2"`.

### `spec_version`

The value for this field **MUST** be `"2.0"`.

### `creator_notes`

The value for this field **MUST NOT** be used inside prompts. The value for this field **SHOULD** be very discoverable for bot users (at least one paragraph **SHOULD** be displayed).

### `system_prompt`

Frontends' default behavior **MUST** be to replace what users understand to be the "system prompt" global setting with the value inside this field. (Exception: if the field value is an empty string, the user's "system prompt" setting or an internal fallback **MUST** be used.)

Frontends **MUST** support the `{{original}}` placeholder, which is replaced with the "system prompt" string that the frontend would have used in the absence of a character `system_prompt` (e.g. the user's own system prompt).

Frontends **MAY** offer ways to replace or supplement character cards' system prompt (in addition to directly editing the card), but it **MUST NOT** be the default behavior.

### `post_history_instructions`

Frontends' default behavior **MUST** be to replace what users understand to be the "ujb/jailbreak" setting with the value inside this field. (Exception: if the field value is an empty string, the user's "ujb/jailbreak" setting or an internal fallback **MUST** be used.)

Frontends **MUST** support the `{{original}}` placeholder, which is replaced with the "ujb/jailbreak" string that the frontend would have used in the absence of a character `system_prompt` (e.g. the user's own ujb/jailbreak).

Frontends **MAY** offer ways to replace or supplement character cards' post_history_instructions (in addition to directly editing the card), but it **MUST NOT** be the default behavior.

### `alternate_greetings`

Array of strings.

Frontends **MUST** offer "swipes" on character first messages, each string inside this array being an additional "swipe".

### `character_book`

A character-specific lorebook. 

Find the typing for this field in the [New fields intro](#new-fields).

Frontends **MUST** use the character lorebook by default.

Character editors **MUST** save character lorebooks in the specified format.

Character lorebook **SHOULD** stack with user "world book"/"world info"/"memory book". (Character book **SHOULD** take full precedence over world book.)

### `tags`

An array of strings.

There is no restriction on what strings are valid.

This field **SHOULD NOT** be used in the prompt engineering.

This field **MAY** be used for frontend sorting/filtering purposes (**SHOULD** be
case-insensitive).

### `creator`

This field **MUST NOT** be used for prompt engineering.

This field **MAY** be shown on frontends.

### `character_version`

This field **MUST NOT** be used for prompt engineering.

This field **MAY** be shown on frontends and used for sorting.

### `extensions`

This field **MUST** default to an empty object (`{}`).

This field **MAY** contain any arbitrary JSON key-value pair.

Character editors **MUST NOT** destroy unknown key-value pairs when importing and exporting character cards.

Applications **MAY** store any unspecified data in this object.

Applications **SHOULD** namespace any key they use to prevent conflicts, e.g.
`"agnai/voice": /* ... */` or `"agnai_voice": /* ... */` or `"agnai": { "voice": /* ... */ }"`.
